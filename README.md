# BeaconBubbles
This mod allows you to create Bubble Columns when a beacom beam passes through water! 
This also allows to have spaces between columns without needing soulsand or other blocks that block the beam!

## How to create a Beacon Bubble Column
Make a beacon platform, place a beacon there. If the beacon is not obstructed it will create the beam. Now every water that the beam touches will become a bubble column! (Side effect: non-source blocks will become source blocks!)

The water doesn't need to touch the Beacon block, you can also put a sign, fence gate or trapdoor in between them, to suspend the water mid air!
